      <h2>About Diabetic retinopathy</h2>
      <p class="info">
        Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes, caused by high blood
        sugar levels damaging the back of the eye (retina).
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
         It can cause
        blindness if left undiagnosed and untreated. However, it usually takes
        several years for diabetic retinopathy to reach a stage where it could
        threaten your sight. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        To minimise the risk of this happening, people with
        diabetes should: ensure they control their blood sugar levels, blood
        pressure and cholesterol attend diabetic eye screening appointments â€“
        annual screening is offered to all people with diabetes aged 12 and over
        to pick up and treat any problems early on
